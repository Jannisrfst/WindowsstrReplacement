Windows String Replacement (Theoretical)


This repository contains a theoretical C++ program that demonstrates how one might interact with the Windows API to enumerate all open windows and replace the text in each window.

# Disclaimer
This code is purely theoretical and is intended for educational purposes only. It is a simplified example that does not account for the complexities of real-world applications and systems. The code does not actually perform any string replacement in real-world scenarios.

The code demonstrates:

- How to enumerate all open windows using the EnumWindows function.
- How to get and set the text of a window using the GetWindowText and SetWindowText functions.
- A theoretical approach to replacing all characters in a window's text with a specific character.
# Usage
The code is not intended to be run. It is for illustrative purposes only.
